# Malware-Detector

Blockchain based Malware detector

# Aim

Our aim is to accept the block or not based on proof of work based consensus. SInce the portable executable file is also an image file, we simply convert this problem into a image classsification problem and use it for classification of images as malicious or normal based on trained data.

# Note:
It prevents the malicious content from crossing the firewall and here, we plan to build a firewall which runs on a blockchain, which also help us gather insights and links between the machine learning algorithms and blockchain. We tried to think differently and convert a serious problem into a good machine learning challenge, by converting our PE files(Portable execuatble)  into a image array and reduce its size by Python imaging library. We trained the data based on train data which the ML algorithm will draw insights and decide weights for our neural network which in turns helps in classification of the file as malicious or not. But we will not block the content but will bring out a query for the user to decide, and also it works on proof of work based consensus.
